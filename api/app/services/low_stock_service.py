"""Restock reminders: tell the Office Staff when a consumable is due to be bought again.

Consumables are not counted, so there is no stock level to fall below. The
replenishment forecast (``replenishment_service``) gives the date each item is
usually bought next; one alert is raised per item and expected date once that
date is ``DUE_SOON_DAYS`` away or has passed. Recording the purchase moves the
expected date, so the next cycle alerts again. The alert kind keeps its stored
name, LOW_STOCK. Runs with the page-open and daily background checks. Commits.

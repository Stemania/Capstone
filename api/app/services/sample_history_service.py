"""Local sample transaction history.

``generate`` adds job orders, purchasing, shop-floor time, attendance and
inventory movements that reference the shop's existing people, machines,
clients, suppliers and catalog. It does not create or edit those master rows.

The only existing values it changes are consumable ``quantity_on_hand``.
Each of those is snapshotted in ``sample_records.detail`` and restored by
``remove``. Holiday rows it inserts are tracked the same way and deleted
by ``remove``. Tool-unit custody is left as it was: borrow and return are
new events only.

Dry run builds one transaction, returns the summary, and rolls it back.

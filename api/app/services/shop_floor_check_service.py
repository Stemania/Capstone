"""Checks on work already on the shop floor, and moving work off a broken unit.

* Overruns: an in-progress or paused operation whose projected finish runs
  past its planned end and now clashes with later work of the same worker or
  unit. The affected unstarted operations move later with the normal
  scheduler (workers and units kept, nothing earlier), each move goes into the
  move history, and the Admin is told.
* Stalled: paused for more than one working day without a resume. The Admin
  is told so a person decides (resume, re-plan or reassign); its booking stops
  growing meanwhile (see ``schedule_service.stalled_since``).
* End of shift: work still running after the worker's shift has ended (they
  went home without pausing) is paused at the end of the shift, or at the
  clock-out the Admin recorded, so overnight hours are not counted as work.
* Down units: released unstarted operations booked on a unit that is down are
  flagged; with no expected repair date and no other unit of the type the job
  is marked Needs re-plan. A passed expected repair date on a unit still down
  asks the Admin to update it.

``run_checks`` runs with the other background checks (API start, daily and on
page open) and after a pause or resume is recorded.

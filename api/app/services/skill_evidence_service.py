"""Evidence behind a worker's skill levels, and a suggested level per machine.

The Administrator still sets every level. This only shows what the shop's own
records say, so a rating has a basis besides memory:

* how many operations the worker finished on each machine type in the last
  12 months, as the lead and as a helper, and when he last did one;
* speed against peers: for each of his operations, the hours his peers
  usually take for the same operation type (their target hours over their
  actual hours) are compared with the hours he took, so generous targets or
  an easy job mix do not make him look better than he is;
* how often he finishes within 10% of target or faster;
* redo caused by the operator: completed operations he led that were sent
  back for operator error, out-of-tolerance dimensions, or surface finish.
  Machine faults and wrong material are not his doing and are left out.

Suggested level (never applied by itself):

  fewer than 5 operations as lead  -> no suggestion, except 1 when he has only
                                      helped on that machine (5 or more times)
  volume sets the ceiling           -> 5+ lead ops: up to 3, 15+: up to 4,
                                      30+: up to 5
  quality caps it                   -> operator redo above 10%: at most 2
  speed against peers places it     -> 95% or more of peers' speed: the
                                      ceiling; 85-95%: one below; slower: 2

The on-target rate is shown for information only: it depends on how tight
the Administrator set each target, which the comparison with peers does not.

A level 2 or more away from the suggestion, or a skill unused for six months,
is flagged for the Administrator to review.
